    <h2>In the breakfast of the Egyptian people, there is Ta'ameya (falafel)</h2>
    <p>Ta'ameya (Egyptian falafel) is an all-time favorite street food in Egypt.
       In most parts of the Middle East, falafel is made with ground chickpeas. </p>
    <p>In Egypt however, we make it with dried fava beans. These are best served with pita bread,
       tomato, onions, and tahini sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups dried split fava beans</li>
        <li>1 red onion, quartered</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh parsley</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh dill</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 cup sesame seeds (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place fava beans into large bowl and cover with several inches of water. Let soak, 8 hours to overnight. Drain.</li>
        <li>Combine soaked fava beans, red onion, parsley, cilantro, dill, garlic, coriander, salt, and cumin in a food processor; process to a dough-like consistency.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add sesame seeds; cook, stirring occasionally, until toasted, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large plate.</li>
        <li>Shape fava bean mixture into about 50 balls. Roll balls in sesame seeds to coat.</li>
        <li>Fill a large saucepan 1/4 full with oil; heat over medium heat. Fry fava bean balls in batches until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels.</li>
